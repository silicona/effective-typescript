This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is
offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You
do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a
significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses
several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or
distributing examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a
question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require
permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book
into your product’s documentation does require permission.

We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes
the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example:
“Effective TypeScript by Dan Vanderkam (O’Reilly). Copyright 2020 Dan Vanderkam,

or the permission given above, feel free to contact us at
